# Hello-World
First online , hoping to learn far more
 Hi, my name is Rob and I'm 50 years old. I always wanted to learn coding, but I becaame a single father of 2 wonderful children.
 I have always been interested into computers and how they operated, so I help friends and family to learn the basic to use a PC.
 Over the years I became self-taught in everything that I learned. 
 Struggling between working a full-time job and taking care of the children there was no time for learning.
 Now I found more passion in the computer world than ever.
